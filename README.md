# Seaborn
I have made a note for Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. It contains some important topics that should be focused more.

## The contents I covered:
1. What is Seaborn?
2. Why use Seaborn over Matplotlib?
3. How to install Seaborn?
4. Importing and loading datasets
5. Basic Plot
6. Categorical Plot
7. Relationship Plot
8. Heatmap
9. Seaborn Themes and Styling
